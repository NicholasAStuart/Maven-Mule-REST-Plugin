#Maven Mule REST Plugin#

This is a project to utilize the RESTful interface that is provided for the Management console on Mule ESB's Enterprise Edition. 

This plugin assumes that you have configured the [maven-mule-plugin](https://github.com/mulesoft/maven-mule-plugin) to generated the mule application archive

This is a personal project and is not affiliated with MuleSoft or the maven mule plugin in any way.

Example:

	<project>
		...
		<build>
			<plugins>
				<plugin>
					<groupId>com.github.nicholasastuart</groupId>
					<artifactId>mule-mmc-rest-plugin</artifactId>
					<version>1.2.0</version>
				</plugin>
			</plugins>
		</build>
		...
	</project>

This goal will
*   delete an existing mule application archive from the MMC Repository if version contains "SNAPSHOT"
*	upload the mule application archive to the MMC Repository
*	delete an existing deployment having the same application name
*	create a new deployment this the uploaded archive, with target the given serverGroup
